# Data Structure: 
### B-Tree
A B-Tree (also known as Balanced Tree) is a self-balancing tree designed to overcome the limitations of traditional binary search trees. Unlike binary trees, B-Trees can store multiple keys in a single node, leading to a larger branching factor and shallower height. Shallow height results in faster search and insertion operations, making B-Trees ideal for storage systems with slow data access (e.g., hard drives, flash memory, CD-ROMs).
#### Common Used For: 
- Databases: B-Trees store indexes for efficient data searching and retrieval.
- File Systems: B-Trees organize and store files efficiently.
- Operating Systems: B-Trees manage memory efficiently.
- CAD Systems: B-Trees organize and search geometric data.
- Natural Language Processing, Computer Networks, and Cryptography also utilize B-Trees.
